# Data-Manipulation-With-Python
Data manipulation is not changing the data value, but it makes a machine easy to analyze the data.

## Pandas Series
A Pandas Series is a one-dimensional array holding data of any type.

## Labels
Labels need not be unique but must be a hashable type. The object supports both integer- and label-based indexing and provides a host of methods for performing operations involving the index. Statistical methods from ndarray have been overridden to automatically exclude missing data (currently represented as NaN).

#Key/Value Objects as Series
Anda juga dapat menggunakan objek kunci/nilai, seperti kamus, saat membuat Seri.

## Loc
loc is label-based, which means that you have to specify rows and columns based on their row and column labels.

## Iloc
iloc is integer position-based, so you have to specify rows and columns by their integer position values (0-based integer position).
